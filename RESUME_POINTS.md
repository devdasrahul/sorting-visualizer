# ATS-Friendly Resume Points

Here are three strong, action-oriented bullet points you can add to your resume for this project:

1. **Developed an interactive Sorting Algorithm Visualizer using Python and Pygame**, implementing 7+ algorithms (including Quick, Merge, and Heap Sort) to demonstrate **O(n log n)** efficiency and DSA concepts in real-time.
2. **Engineered a custom generator-based animation system** to render step-by-step visualizations of comparisons and swaps, optimizing rendering performance to maintain **60 FPS** for arrays up to 200 elements.
3. **Designed an educational user interface** featuring dynamic Time/Space Complexity metrics and live operation counters, enhancing user understanding of **Big-O notation** and algorithm performance characteristics.
